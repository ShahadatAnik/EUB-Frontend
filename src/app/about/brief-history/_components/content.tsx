						The university’s expansive permanent campus, spanning 550,000 square feet, is
						strategically located in the heart of Dhaka City, within the prestigious institutional
						zone of Gabtoli (opposite the Gabtoli Bus Terminal). In the relatively short span of its
						operation, EUB&apos;s student population has grown exponentially, surpassing 24,000
						students within its first five years.
						<br />
						<br />
						EUB has a faculty of 480 distinguished academics, all holding exceptional qualifications
						from leading universities in Bangladesh and abroad. The university is dedicated to
						making higher education accessible to talented students from middle-income to
						underprivileged backgrounds. It offers some of the lowest tuition fees in the country,
						ensuring affordability for economically disadvantaged and working students.
						<br />
						<br />
						EUB maintains rigorous academic standards, ensuring fair examinations, a modular
						education system, continuous faculty development, research and development initiatives,
						and various promotional policies. Additionally, EUB actively involves students in
						university activities, fostering engagement and hands-on experience. For instance, the
						construction of its permanent campus—from design and planning to implementation and
						monitoring—is managed by students from the Civil Engineering, Electrical & Electronic
						Engineering (EEE), and Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) departments.
